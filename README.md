# Wordle

## My first use of testing! 🤓❤️

I built this [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) clone in vanilla JS. The testing library is [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) (such a thoughtful developer experience 🥰). I also used [Happy DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/happy-dom) to emulate DOM manipulations (⚡️ fast).

You can try it live [here](https://foadbotan.github.io/wordle). Check out the console for a bit of help 🤫.
